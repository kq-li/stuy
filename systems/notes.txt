Aim: Variables are the spice of life.
Do Now: What are the primitive variable types in Java?

C primitives:
int         4B        -2^31 to 2^31 - 1    ~2.1b
short       2B        -2^15 to 2^15 - 1    32768
long        8B        -2^63 to 2^63 - 1    big
char        1B        -2^7 to 2^7 - 1      256

float       4B        7 digits of precision
double      8B        14 digits of precision

All primitives in C are numeric - the only differences between them are floating
point vs integer and size of variable.

Size can be platform-dependent.
sizeof(<TYPE>) can be used to find the size in bytes
    ex: sizeof(int)

Aim: Don't forget to read the fine print
Do Now: What is the smallest variable type that could be used to store the
        following values (using standard sizes)?

1) 5 - char
2) -30,000 - long
3) 255 - int
4) 5,000,000,000 - long

C Primitive Variable Types
  All boolean values are numbers
    0 -> false
    anything else -> true

printf
  The most important C function!

  Prints formatted strings

  printf(<string literal>, [<var1>, <var2>, ...])
