A mode is a value in an array that is larger than both the value immediately
before it in the array and the value immediately after it. In other words, a
mode occurs at index k in the array A  if A[k] > A[k - 1]  and A[k] > A[k + 1].

The array is unimodal if the values increase until they reach a mode, then
decrease, so that there is only one mode. For example, the array A  shown below
is unimodal with its mode occurring at index 4.

Assume that the mode does not occur at the first or last entry in the array.

Index k     A[k]
  0         3
  1         5
  2         9
  3        10
  4        12   <---mode
  5        11
  6         9
  7         4

Part (A)
=========
Write function isMode,as started below. isMode returns true if data[k] is
larger than data[k - 1] and larger than data[k + 1]; otherwise, it returns
false.

In the example above,the call isMode(A, 4) returns true 
and the call isMode(A, 5) returns false.

Complete function isMode below.

        // precondition: 0 < k < data.length
	 public static boolean isMode(int[] data, int k){}




Part (B)
=========
Write function modeIndex, as started below. modeIndex returns the index of
the mode of data.

You may assume that data is unimodal and the mode occurs at an index k,
where 0 < k < data.length - 1.

In the example above, the call modeIndex(A) returns 4.
In writing modeIndex, you may call function isMode specified in part (a).
Assume that isMode works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).

Complete function modeIndex below.


public static int modeIndex(int[] data)
// precondition:  data is unimodal and data.length ≥ 3


Part C
=======
Write function printHistogram, as started below.
printHistogram prints a String histogram of a unimodal array of nonnegative
values, data, such that the longest bar of the histogram (the mode) has
longestBar characters barChar, and all other bars have a number of barChar 
characters proportional to the corresponding value in the array data (rounding
down).

For example, assume that the array data contains the values shown below.
The call
 printHistogram(data, 20, "x") 

will print the histogram shown in the Output column below.
Index k     data[k] Length of bar Output of call
                                  PrintHistogram (data, 20, "x")
  0           3             5          xxxxx
  1           5             8          xxxxxxxx
  2           9            15          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  3          10            16          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  4          12            20          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  5          11            18          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  6           9            15          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  7           4             6          xxxxxx

In writing printHistogram,you may call functions isMode and modeIndex 
specified in parts (a) and (b). Assume that isMode and modeIndex 
work as specified, regardless of what you wrote in parts (a) and (b).
Complete function printHistogram below.


public static void printHistogram(int[] data, int longestBar, String barChar)
// precondition:  data is unimodal and data.length ≥ 3;
//                data[k] ≥ 0 for 0 ≤ k < data.length
