Implement a Tile object.

A Tile object is either face-up or face-down. On the face of a tile is a word.
On the back of a tile is "X".




public class Tile{
       private String _image;
       private boolean _faceUp;

       // Constructs a Tile whose faceUp and show word
       public Tile(String word){
       	      _image = word;	
	      _faceUp = true;
       }
       
       // returns image on face of Tile
       public String showFace(){}

       // Returns true if Tile is face-up, false otherwise.
       public boolean isFaceUp() {}

       // Returns true if the image on other is the same as this image.
       public boolean equals (Object other){}

       // Postcondition: Tile is turned face-up
       public void turnFaceUp(){}

       //Postcondition: Tile is turned face-down
       public void turnFaceDown(){}

       // returns the image when the tile is face-up
       // otherwise returns "X"
       public String toString(){ }

}
