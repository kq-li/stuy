Due: Tues., 1/12


1. From the Labs/Concentration folder download FooList.java and Tile.java.

2. Review and run those files.

3. In FooList.java, add the following methods:

    a. int size()  - returns the size of a FooList.
    b. boolean isEmpty() - returns true if a FooList is empty
                         - false otherwise
    c. boolean equals(Object rhs)
         - returns true if 2 FooLists have the same size and
	   contain the same elements in the same order.
	   Otherwise, it returns false.

4. Test these  methods in FooList.java.

5. Classify the runtime complexity of all the FooList methods.

6. In the main method of Tile.java, declare an ArrayList of Tiles
   and add tiles to the list.

7. Traverse through this list and turn each tile face down.
