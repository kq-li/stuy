Here is an AP style question.


I. Create a file Flier.java that represents the Flier interface.

   Here's the code.

    public interface Flier{
    	   void fly();
    }

   An object that flies  implements this interface such as Birds, Airplanes,
   etc..


II. Create a interface Athlete. Athletes train so include the following method
    in the interface.

    void train(double hours);


III. Create a class SkiJumper. A SkiJumper represents a person who
     keeps track of their training by recording the number of jumps they've 
     made and the hours they have trained. 
     SkiJumper are both fliers and athletes so this
     class should implement both of the above interfaces. To implement multiple
     interface the heading of the class should be: 

     public class SkiJumper implements Flier, Athlete 


     A SkiJumper has the following instance variables :

       String _firstName, _lastName;
       double _hoursTraining;
       int _numberOfJumps;

     a. Create a constructor for SkiJumper that initializes name and sets
        the training data to 0.

         public SkiJumper(String first, String last)


     b. Implement the fly() method that represents a jump.

     c. Implement the train(double) method to record the duration of a training
        session.

     d. Implement the accessor method getHoursTrained().

     e. Implement the accessor method getJumps().


     f. Write a Client class for SkiJumper that tests your code.

     g. Adjust the SkiJumper class so that the Comparable interface is realized
        by the SkiJumper class. SkiJumper objects are compared by the number
        of jumps completed.
