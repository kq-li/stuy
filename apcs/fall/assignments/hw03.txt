Due: Monday 9/21

1. First Test: 9/25

2. Read chapter 1 in ThinkJava.

3. Complete the QuadSolver.java program that we started in class.
   The program should read the 3 coefficients from the command line
   then output the roots of the quadratic equation.

   quadratic equation : ax*x + bx + c = 0
   
   ex. If the quadratic is, x*x + x - 2 = 0 then the roots will be
       -2.0 and 1.0.

    Sample run:
    > java QuadSolver 1.0 1.0 -2.0
      roots: -2.0, 1.0
