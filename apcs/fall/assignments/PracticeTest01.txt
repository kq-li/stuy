Practice exam 1.

1. Convert the following binary numbers into decimal numbers.

   a. 0101 = 5
   b. 0111 = 7
   c. 0000 = 0
   d. 1111 = 15


2. Represent the following decimal numbers in two's complement notation using
   5 bits.

   a. 10  = 01010
   b. -10 = 10101
   c. 15  = 01111
   d. 16  = impossible with 5 bits

3. Assume 5 bit two's complement notation.
   a. What is the maximum integer represented? 15
   b. What is the minimum integer represented? -16
   c. If int a = <the maximum integer> what is the value of 3 * a? 13
 
4. What is the value of Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE)?
   Integer.MIN_VALUE

5. What is the value of 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.2?
   true

6. Why does 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 evaluate to false?
   Decimal addition in a binary computer system is inaccurate because of the inability of a computer to express 0.1 as a terminating binary fraction.




*****************Programming Problems *******************

1. Write a program that prints a truth tables. See TruthTable.txt for 
   the desired output.
  public class TruthTable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("A	B	A&&B	A||B	!A	!(A&&B)	!A||!B");
      System.out.println("=========================================================");
      System.out.println("true	true	true	true	false	false	false");
      System.out.println("true	false	false	true	false	true	true");
      System.out.println("false	true	false	true	true	true	true");
      System.out.println("false	false	false	false	true	true	true");
    }
  }


2. Write a program that reads a year from the command line, and determines
   if the year is a leap year. The rules for a leap year are as follow:
     - any year divisible by 400 is a leap year.
     - all other leap years are years divisible by 4 but not by 100.

   Sample Run:
   $java LeapYear 2000
   $ Is a leap year: true
   $java LeapYear 2004
   $ Is a leap year: true
   $java LeapYear 2005
   $ Is a leap year: false
   $java LeapYear 2100
   $ Is a leap year: false

  public class LeapYear {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int year = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      System.out.println("Is a leap year: " + (year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)));
    }
  }

   
3. Write a program to determine the monthly payments of a car loan.
   Let P be the principal, r the yearly interest rate compounded continuously,
   and t the duration in years of the loan. Use the formula Pe^(rt). The 
   Math library provides the function:
      
      double  Math.exp(double)

   Have the user enter the values of P,r, and t at the command line.
   
  public class CarLoan {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      double P = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
      double r = Double.parseDouble(args[1]);
      double t = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);
      System.out.println(P * Math.exp(r * t));
    }
  }
