Due: Monday 11/16

1. In the Labs folder, review CheckSumII.txt.
   It has the solutions to the code we completed in class.

   You may change the return type of randomAccount() to long if you wish.
   If you do, you may need to explicitly state where the longs are used
   within your code by placing a L next to the data. For example,
   3 is an int data type where as 3L is a long.

2. Complete questions 3 and 4 from the lab.
