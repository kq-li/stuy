1. Write FencePosts.java that reads a positive integer and prints out 
   a fence. Use "|" as a post and "---" as the chain.

          $ |
	  $ java FencePosts 2
          $ |---|
          $ java FencePosts 3
          $ |---|---|


2. Write TossWeightedDie.java that simulates tossing a weighted die N times.
   Use these probabilities:
     P(1) = P(6) = 10%
     P(2) = P(5) = 15%
     P(3) = P(4) = 25%
