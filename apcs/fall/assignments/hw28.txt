1. Exam 12/04 (Friday)

  Topics:
   - AP String methods
   - Recursion
   - Java methods
         - mathematical functions
	 - function side effects
    - Comparable interface
          - int compareTo(Comparable)
    - Sorting
         - bogoSort
         - bubbleSort
         - selectionSort
         - insertionSort


2. In the Classwork folder review the newest versions of :
        - ArrayIO.java
        - Stats.java
        - Sorts.java
        - SortTester.java

3. Answer the following questions regarding the bubblesort.
   a. If N is the data size how many comparisons will be performed by the bubblesort.
	N - 1 + N - 2 + N - 3 + ... + 1 = (N - 1)(N) / 2
   b. If N is the data size what is the maximum number of swaps performed.
	(N - 1)(N) / 2
      When will this occur?
	When the array is in reverse order
   c. What is the minimum number of swaps? When will this occur?
	0
	When the array is alerady sorted
   d. Without using the method isSorted(Comparable [] x) write a verison of the bubblesort
      algorithm that will exit early when the data is sorted. Use the following function heading:

        public static void bubbleSortModified(Comparable [] x);
