1. Gaussian random numbers. One way to generate a random number taken from the Gaussian(Normal) distribution is 
   to use the Box-Muller formula

           w = sin(2 pi v)(-2 ln u)^(1/2)   where pi is pi, ln is the natural log, ^ is the exponent operator.

   u and v are real numbers between 0 and 1 generated by Math.random(). Write a program StandardGauss that
   prints out a standard Gaussian random variable. 


2. Write a program, VerifyStdGauss, to verify that your StandardGauss program works by
   letting the program run N times and prints the distribution seen in normal67.img.
   N should be an integer provided at the command-line.

3. Rewrite TenHellos to make a program Hellos that takes the number of lines to print as a command-line
   argument. You may assume that the argument is less than 1000.

4. Write a program that takes 5 distinct integers from the command line and prints the median value.
