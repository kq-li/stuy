Due: Thursday 9/20

1. Review IntOps.java.
2. Read the preface of ThinkJava.
3. Write the program MinChange.java. It should read an argument
   from the command line that represents cents then print the minimum
   number of coins to comprise the cents. Assume the coins are
   quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies.

   Here is a sample run.
   > java MinChange 108
     # quarters : 4
     # dimes : 0
     # nickels : 1
     # pennies: 3
     minimum coins : 8

Email the solution to yourself.
