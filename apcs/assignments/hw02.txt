Here's a short lesson on Two's Complement Notation:
  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html

Answer the following questions:

1. Convert the following binary numbers into a decimal numbers.

   a.  00101 = 5
   b.  01101 = 13


2. Add the following 3 bit binary numbers.

   a. 001 + 011 = 100
   b. 011 + 101 = 000


3. Write the following decimal numbers in two's complement notation.
   Assume you have 4 bits.

   a. 5 = 0101
   b. -5 = 1010

4. Given 4 bit two complement notation, what are the maximum and minimum decimal numbers represented?
max = 7
min: -8
