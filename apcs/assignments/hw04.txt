Due: Tues., 9/22

1. Exam Friday 9/25

2. Before Friday, read Chapter 2 in ThinkJava.

3. Evaluate the following expresssions by identifying the result type of the
   operator with the highest precedence on each successive line. 
   
   For example,

        5 + 3 == 2 == 1 * 3
        5 + 3 == int == int
        int == int == int
        boolean == int
        Compilation Error

   a.    1 > 3 >= 3 + 1
         1 > 3 >= int
         boolean >= int
         Compilation Error

   b.   !(2 == 4) != 2 > 5 - 2
        !(2 == 4) != 2 > int
        !(boolean) != boolean
        boolean != boolean
        boolean
