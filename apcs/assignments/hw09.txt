1. In the classwork folder review the most upto date versions of Factors.java and LetsMakeADeal.java.

2. Write a class to simulate the gambler's ruin problem.
   
   Assume a gambler makes a series of $1 fair bets at a casino. The gambler begins the gambling session
   with an initial stake and a goal in mind. The gambler will bet until either the goal is reached or 
   all cash is exhausted (bust).

   For instance, say the stake is $20 and the goal is $100. The gambler will bet until they have $100 or $0.
   
   Keep track of the number of bets taken during a session.
  
   Verify the following theorems in probability:
     1. The probability of reaching the goal is equal to the ratio of the stake to the goal.
        For the above case, the gambler has a 20% chance of hitting the goal.

     2. The expected number of bets to reach the goal or go bust is equal to the product of the expected gain
        and the initial stake. ( Expect an average of 1600 bets for the above case.)
