Consider the Eight (N) Queens problem. It requires determining the
various ways in which eight queens could be configured on a chessboard
so that none of them could capture any other queen. (The rules of 
chess allow a queen to move in an arbitrary number of squares in 
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal fashion.) The figure below illustrates
one such configuration.
