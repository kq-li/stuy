

1. Simulate the Hot Potato Game
   ============================
   In this game, children form a circle then pass a hot potato
   around the circle while music plays. As the object is passed from 
   one child to another, an adult will randomly stop the music. Upon which,
   the child holding the hot potato is removed from the circle. The game
   continues with the next child until there is one child remaining.

   Use a Round Robin Scheduler to simulate the child's game Hot Potato.



2. Create the class Stackq that uses 2 queues to implement a stack.
