Due. Thurs. 4/15

1. In the Java Math class look up floorMod(int, int).

2. Evaluate the following:

   a. floorMod(-1,5) 

   b. floorMod(-2,5)
	
   c. floorMod(-3,5)


3. Given the ArrayDeque implementation discussed in class.
   Note the following:   
	Let the capacity be one less then the length of the array.
   In other words, if the capacity is 5 then the length of the 
   array will be 6. One location will not be given a value.
   
	
        Let _head be the index position of the first open location 
   to store a new head and _tail to be first open location to store
   a new tail.

   If _head = 0, _tail = 1, _capacity = 5 and the following 
   methods are called:
   
    addFirst("a");
    addFirst("b");
    offerLast("c");
    offerFirst("d");
    pollFirst();
    offerLast("e");
   
   What are the values of _head and _tail?


   What will the ArrayDeque look like?

   What will the array representing the Deque look like?

4. You will be given time in class tomorrow to complete the ArrayDeque.


 


	   Array          _head       _tail         ArrayDeque	
	   		     0            1             []
