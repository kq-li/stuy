Write a program to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures,
bears and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as
a relatively large array. Each cell of the array should contain an Animal
object, which can be a Bear object, a Fish object, or null. In each step,
bears and fish attempt to move into adjacent array cells or they can stay
where they are, at random. If two animals of the same type are about to 
collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create
a new instance of that type of animal, which is placed in a random empty
cell in the array. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish
dies. Use actual object creation, via the new operator, to model the creation
of new objects, and provide a visualization of the array after each time
step.


***** TRY NOT TO USE THE instanceof OPERATOR ******
Instead use classes, subclasses, interfaces, and polymorphism.

Suggestions:
 Create classes Animal, Bear, Fish, and Ecosystem.
 Use the following is a relationships:
   Bear is an Animal
   Fish is an Animal
 Use the following has a relationship:
   Animal has an Ecosystem such that each Animal keeps track
   of its river and position in the river.
