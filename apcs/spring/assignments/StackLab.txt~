1. Write the ArrayStack method transferTo(ArrayStack<E> rhs) that transfers
   the elements from the stack to rhs until either the stack is empty
   or rhs is full.

  public void transferTo(ArrayStack<E> rhs){
  	 < your code goes here>     
  }

2. Assume there are 3 array stacks, A, B and C. 
   A has a capacity of 100 and is full.
   B has a capacity of 5 and is empty.
   C has a capacity or 3 and is also empty.

   Using only the transferTo method, how would you get 4 elements into 
   Stack B
			 // 100 0 0
	A.transferTo(B); // 95 5 0
	B.transferTo(C); // 95 2 3
	C.transferTo(A); // 98 2 0
	B.transferTo(C); // 98 0 2
	A.transferTo(B); // 93 5 2
	B.transferTo(C); // 93 4 3


3. Implement the stack ADT using the Java ArrayList class.
   Using only AP ArrayList methods in your solution.
