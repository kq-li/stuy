Write a simulator as in the previous project, but add a Boolean gender field
and a floating-point strength field to each Animal object. Now, if two animals
of the same type try to collide, then they only create a new instance of that
type of animal if they are of different genders. Otherwise, if two animals
of the same type and gender try to collide, then only the one of larger 
strength survives.
