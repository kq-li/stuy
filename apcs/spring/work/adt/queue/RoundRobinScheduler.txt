 Round Robin Scheduler
=======================

A popular use of a queue data structure is to implement a Round Robin Scheduler,
where we iterate through a collection of elements in a circular fashion and
"service" each element by performing a given action on it.

1. c <- Q.dequeue()
2. Service element c
3. Q.enqueue(c)
