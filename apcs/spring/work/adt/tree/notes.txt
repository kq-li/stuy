Binary Trees
============

In a binary tree, each node has one parent except the root node. Each node
contains references to its left and right children; a null value indicates that
the corresponding child is not in the tree. A node that has no children is
called a leaf. Each node is the root of a smaller binary tree.

Ex.               1
                /   \
              2       3
               \     / \
                4   5   6
                   / \
                  7   8

Questions:

1. How many nodes are in this tree? 8
2. What is the root node? 1
3. How many leaves are in this tree? 4
4. Which nodes are leaves? 4, 7, 8, 6
5. What is the parent node of 5? 3
6. What are the children of 2? 4

Definition: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from root to
            leaf (the number of links from root to leaf).j

7. What is the height of the tree? 3

** Trees are almost always handled recursively. **

Tree Traversals
===============

A traversal occurs when each node of a tree is visited.

There are 3 common types of tree traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder.

An inorder traversal recursively follows these 3 steps:
  1. go left if possible
  2. process the node
  3. go right if possible

What is the inorder traversal of the above tree? 2 4 1 7 5 8 3 6

A preorder traversal recursively follows these 3 steps:
  1. process the node
  2. go left if possible
  3. go right if possible

What is the preorder traversal of the above tree? 1 2 4 3 5 7 8 6

A postorder traversal recursively follows these 3 steps:
  1. go left if possible
  2. go right if possible
  3. process the node

What is the postorder traversal of the above tree? 4 2 7 8 5 6 3 1

Given the following traversals, construct the corresponding binary tree:
inorder: 3, 10, 8, 4, 9, 7, 11
preorder: 4, 8, 3, 10, 7, 9, 11
postorder: 10, 3, 8, 9, 11, 7, 4

           4
         /   \
       8       7
     /       /   \
   3       9       11
     \
       10

A balanced tree is a tree with the minimum possible maximum height.

A binary search tree is a binary tree with an ordering property.
  - We will use the following ordering property:
    - Given a root, the items contained in the left subtree are less than the root;
      the items in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the root.
  - The benefit of a BST is that in a balanced BST, the following operations are
    O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.
    - find(x)
    - insert(x)
    - remove(x)

Insertion
- Given a value x, start at the root and insert x as a leaf following these steps.
  1. If the tree is empty, x is the root.
  2. If x is less than the current root, go left.
  3. If x is greater than or equal to the current root, go right.

Draw the tree resulting from the insertion of 4, 8, 12, 5, 14, 21, 2, 1.

            2   8
           /   / \

                     \
                      21

Is this BST balanced? No

Rearrange the sequence to produce a balanced tree.
4, 12, 8, 5, 14, 21, 2, 1

             /     \
            5       21

Draw the BST resulting from the insertion of the following data.
12, 10, 8, 11, 25, 17, 5, 25

              12
            /    \

Is the tree balanced? Yes
