1. Write a program that models a simple game. It should display three
   rectangles of the same color (they can be any color but yellow);
   exactly one of these rectangles , when clicked on, should turn yellow.
   The user must guess which rectangle is hiding the "gold." Your program
   should include a rock class that is clicked on and does nothing, and
   a subclass of that class that turns yellow when clicked on.

2. Write a Snowman class that draws a snowman with a hat. Then make a subclass
   of Snowman, MeltingSnowman. When you click on it, the melting snowman should
   melt (i.e., get smaller and smaller) and gradually disappear. Its
   hat should stay on its head as it melts and eventually be left 
   sitting on the ground.
