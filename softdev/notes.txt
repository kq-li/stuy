  Do Now: In your discussion groups, recall what things were necessary to
          write web based programs in python.

  Softdev toolbox part 1:
    python 2.7
    pip
      Python package manager
      Basic usage: $ pip install <package>
    virtualenv
      Creates a sandbox for your python environment.
      Allows you to maintain a specific python environment without messing with
      the system version.
      Can install packages wiwthout root access to a system.
    flask
      "Microframework" for developing web applications.
      Has its own development web server (no more public_html).
      Contains the following two modules
        werkzeug
          WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) implementation.
          Allows our web apps to respond to web requests.

  Aim: HTML Jinja Warrior
  Do Now: Write a basic HTML file with the correct headers and sections.
          
  HTML Templates (jinja2)
    Takes a lot of the HTML out of your python code.
    Template files must be stored in a templates directory at the same level
    as your Flask app file.

    render_template(file, var1, var2, ...)
      Flask function to take a template file and return it as a string
      Jinja2 has its own language to make templates more powerful
