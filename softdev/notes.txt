  Aim: Take a trip down memory lane
  Do Now: In small groups (~4), discuss some of the similarities and differences
          between Java and Python.

  Aim: Git up! Git on up!
  Do Now: Go to the workshop page on github

  Aim: What are we keeping in that flask?
  Do Now: In your discussion groups, recall what things were necessary to
          write web based programs in python.

  Softdev toolbox part 1:
    python 2.7
    pip
      Python package manager
      Basic usage: $ pip install <package>
    virtualenv
      Creates a sandbox for your python environment.
      Allows you to maintain a specific python environment without messing with
      the system version.
      Can install packages wiwthout root access to a system.
    flask
      "Microframework" for developing web applications.
      Has its own development web server (no more public_html).
      Contains the following two modules
        werkzeug
          WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) implementation.
          Allows our web apps to respond to web requests.
        jinja2
          HTML template engine.
          Easily create multiple pages that share styles and content.

  Aim: There's a webserver in my flask?
  Do Now: Write a python function that simply prints a message
          to standard out. Then call the function in the same program.

  Aim: HTML Jinja Warrior
  Do Now: Write a basic HTML file with the correct headers and sections.
          
  HTML Templates (jinja2)
    Takes a lot of the HTML out of your python code.
    Template files must be stored in a templates directory at the same level
    as your Flask app file.

    render_template(file, var1, var2, ...)
      Flask function to take a template file and return it as a string
      Jinja2 has its own language to make templates more powerful

  Aim: Your desktop might not be organized, but your code will be!

  Example Flask Organization
    flask-app/
      app.py      the actual flask application
      templates/  all your templates
      utils/      extra python modules
      data/       data files

  Aim: Flask: serving artisanal web pages since 2010

  File paths and the flask server
    When a flask app runs, the directory where the flask file exists
    is considered the root directory of the web server.

    The flask web server is configured to serve pages only when:
      1   The requested page is a route in the flask app
      2   The requested page/resource is in the static directory

    All these considerations are based on using Flask's built in webserver
    and are valid during development. When deploying on an existing webserver
    (apache2, nginx), these settings may be different.

  Aim: Requesting assistance
  Do Now: Write an html file that contains a form with a single text box
          and a submit button.

          Write a flask app where the root route renders the
          html form as a template.

  Request object
